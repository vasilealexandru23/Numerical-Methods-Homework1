### Task1 - Markov is coming ...
#### Description:
* Task 1 consists in determining an exit path for a robot from a maze for which we know the starting position. For each step, we have to choose the direction with the highest probability to get the robot out of the maze.

#

### Task2 - Linear Regression
#### Description:
* Task 2 consists in the manipulation of predictions and errors that can appear in the computational processing of a multiple linear regression used in determining some predictions regarding the price of some apartments.

#

### Task2 - MNIST 101
#### Description:
* Task 3 proposes the classification of pictures that contain handwritten decimal digits (from 0 to 9) using a classification model, where each picture is represented by a matrix in gray-scale format with a fixed format (20 x 20). The chosen classifier is a small neural network that contains 3 layers (input, hidden & output).
